# Brain Tumor MRI Classification Dataset Preparation

This notebook focuses on **data analysis**, **class exploration**, and **data augmentation**. Below are the tasks implemented in this notebook:  

1. 🔍 **Class Exploration**  
   - Exploring class distribution  
   - Analyzing image size distribution for both training and testing datasets  

2. 📉 **Dimension Reduction**  
   - Performing necessary dimension reduction  

3. 🛠️ **Pre-processing Tasks**  
   - Applying image processing techniques for effective pre-processing  

4. 🌟 **Data Augmentation**  
   - Enhancing datasets using augmentation techniques  

This workflow ensures better insights into the dataset while preparing it for training and testing!
